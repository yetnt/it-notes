_(Cabled/Wired)_

**Twisted Pair Cable** - consists of two insulated strands of copper wire twisted around each other.

1. Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)
2. Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)

| Advantages           | Disadvantages                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Easy to install      | A cable cannot exceed a certain distance (e.g. 100m)                                                            |
| Easy to troubleshoot | Copper cables have some weaknesses such as Eavesdropping, Attenuation, Crosstalk, Electro-Magnetic Interference |
| Cheap (Cost wise)    | -                                                                                                               |

Eaves dropping

> Singals travelling along copper cables can be intercepted by outsiders

Attenuation

> Copper cables lose signal strength over a distance. They can carry signals only a fraction of the distance of fibre optic cables.

Crosstalk

> Defined as signals from one-line interfering with signals from another line. UTP is particualy susceotible to cross talk

## Fibre-Optic

> High speed data transmission using light pulses through glass/plastic fibres.

> Used in backbone internet connections and long distance telecommunication.

| Advantages                             | Disadvantages                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data is transmitted at high speeds     | More expensive than UTP cables.                            |
| High bandwidth                         | You need an expert to properly install and connect devices |
| Low signal loss over long distance     | Difficult to repair                                        |
| Immune to electromagnetic interference | Fragile cables                                             |
| Greater security                       | -                                                          |
